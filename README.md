Python with pymssql built for Azure
======

## Motivation
We use Azure SQL and managed SQL server instances on Azure. To be able to support them, one needs:

- freetds build with openssl
- latest (2019-05-2010) FreeTDS 1.1 branch including bug fix to be able to connect to managed SQL Server instances
- lxml
